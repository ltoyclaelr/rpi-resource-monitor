Setup is super easy for this

change your ip in app.py make sure its your pis local ip address (i.e. 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)
to find your local ip go to your command line and type

hostname -i

move the folder to /home/YOURUSERNAME/Desktop/

-- setup --
sudo su
set yourself as root (makes updating packages easier)

-- these should take a while so just let it do its thing --
apt update
apt upgrade -y

-- install the necessary software to run --
apt install nano screen python python3 pip apache2 -y

-- by now you should be ready to run the program --
pip install flask
screen python3 app.py

--have the web server run in the background so you can do other things on your pi without the server stopping, here im using screen --
ctrl + A + D

-- check your raspberry pis web monitor --
go to http://YOURIPHERE:5000/

and you should see your temps ram usage and cpu usage
this is VERY barebones so if you want to add anything you can, change what the title is in /templates/index.html and the icon for the tab in /static. add whatever you want lol
